This repo contains the code developed in the undergraduate thesis "Métodos de Quantificação Classify and Count (CC) para Análise de Sentimentos", which is based on the paper _Reassessing "Classify & Count" Quantification Method_, by Moreo and Sebastiani, the original repository is available at https://github.com/AlexMoreo/CC. 

The goal of the project is to incorporate the BERT classifier to the base code, with the addition of a specific optimization protocol that aims to maximize quantification metrics.

## Reproduce Experiments
In order to reproduce the experiments, it is recommended to run using Google Colab.

To evaluate BERT as a quantifier use this notebook:
